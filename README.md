# gator
eurorack CV gate to midi over usb converter using arduino uno.

## Idea
This build is a simple trigger/gate to midi converter. It makes it possible to trigger midi events for your computer or external synths from a modular synth for instance.
Thanks to the [HIDUINO project](https://github.com/ddiakopoulos/hiduino), the arduino is seen as a class compliant midi device.


## Requirements
- Arduino board compatible with HIDUINO.
- 8 npn transitors (such as 2n3904)
- 16x 10k resistors
- 3.5 mm mono jacks
